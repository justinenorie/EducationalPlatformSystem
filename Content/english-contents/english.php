                        <h2>Exploring Philippine Literacy Forms, Genres, Elements, and Traditions</h2>
                        <p>Philippine literature is as rich and diverse as the 7500 plus islands that make up our archipelago. This is not surprising considering that we have 183 living languages (ethnologue.com) across 17 regions comprised of 82 provinces. One can only imagine the many forms of artistic communication (oral or written) that have been passed on to and through generations, communities, and groups. Then and now, literature in the Philippines have come in various genres (forms) and have been appreciated and analyzed for their forms, elements, structures, and traditions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The origin of Philippine literature can only be traced by exploring its evolution from pre-colonial up to the present. Thus, studying the past becomes imperative in understanding the literature of the present. Different genres that appeared from each period seem to reflect the place, language, culture, social and ethnic dimensions of literature produced. The nature and essence of literature has evolved over time. Traditionally, literature was strictly viewed as any form of written works especially during the 18th century. Today, its definition and scope can be considered more restrictive for there are certain standards set by some critiques before a work can be considered as a body of literature. Among the common words used by scholars and other sources that are associated to literature are excellence, expression, experience, artistry, and imagination. Its connection to human life and experiences, wherein audience can easily relate with, is the major characteristic of literature. Emerging habitually into quality literary works will help us gain better understanding of people, society, and culture.
                        </p>
                        <p>The term literature is derived from the Latin word "littera" which means "a letter of the alphabet". According to the website Britannica, literature is traditionally defined as body of written works associated to imaginative and creative works of poetry and prose and can be classified according to variety of systems such as language, national origin, historical period, genre and subject matter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Literature can either be in oral or written form. The oral literature handed down from one generation to another, then later on transformed into written form. The products of written literature are called literary text. A text can be considered literary if it has the elements of psychological characterization and chronology. Also, literature uses literary devices such as metaphor and symbolism. Reading for entertainment and learning is the most common reason why people read literature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Simply, the best way to describe the characteristics of literary text is that (1) it narrates a story; (2) it expresses feelings, thoughts, and ideas which can either be based from the imagination or real life experiences of the author or other people; and (3) it delivers significant information and crosses boundaries of time, places, cultures and languages. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Also, literature contains specific structure. Literary structure refers to the organizational method used in literature in which the most common type is the narrative. Parts of the narrative structure (or plot) are the exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution (denouement). In a much broader context, literary structure is not only limited to content and form but this may also refer to "the general features or characteristic of genre, style, a specific literary trend, literature as an art form, and finally, art as a whole" (The Great Soviet Encyclopedia). For Murphy (n.d.), literary structure may involve arrangement of various elements according to purpose, style, and genre to effectively convey the intended meaning for the audience.

                        <h2>Two Major Forms of Literature</h2>
                        <p>1. Poetry - This literary type is usually written in lines and is characterized by having the element of rhythm, sound, imagery, and form. Its main purpose isto express feelings, thoughts, and ideas. It can be divided into three types: narrative, dramatic, and lyrical poetry.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Narrative Poetry. This poetry tells a story and has the elements of a narrative such as characters, setting, conflict, etc.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Dramatic Poetry. This is an emotionally appealing drama written in verse that tells a story and is intended to be recited or sung in 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;front of the audience by a character speaking in poetry.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Lyric Poetry. It is the most common type of poetry that focuses on expressing feelings rather than telling a story.</p>
                        <p>2. Prose - In contrast to poetry, this literary piece applies a natural flow of speech and grammatical structures which are mainly consisting of complete sentences arranged logically and sequentially in a paragraph form.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Fiction. This serves as a product of the writer's wild imagination and creative thinking where the characters react to the conflict &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and various issues central to the main idea of a literary work. Its three types are: short story, novel, and novella. The main genres are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crime, fantasy, romance, science fiction, western, inspirational, historical fiction and horror.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Non-fiction. These are stories inspired by real events where the writers aim to present, interpret, or describe experiences based &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on facts. The judgments, opinions, and commentaries of the writers may be presented in the form of essays, journals, diaries, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feature articles, editorials, and the like.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                        Genre refers to the forms of literature. The general ones are oral and written. The main types are prose and poetry. There are many other forms that have sprung through the years. Specifically, it is defined in the curriculum guide as something that “may be determined by literary technique, tone, content, or even (as in the case of fiction) length. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups. The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) epic, tragedy, comedy, and creative nonfiction. They can all be in the form of prose or poetry. Additionally, a genre such as satire, allegory or pastoral might appear in any of the above, not only as a sub-genre, but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general cultural movement of the historical period in which they were composed. Genre should not be confused with age categories, by which literature may be classified as either adult, young-adult, or children's. They also must not be confused with format, such as graphic novel or picture book.” (Glossary, Curriculum Guide) 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Literary elements refer “to particular identifiable characteristics of a whole text. They are not “used,” per se, by authors; they represent the elements of storytelling which are common to all literary and narrative forms. For example, every story has a theme, a setting, a conflict, and has a particular point-of-view, etc. In order to be discussed legitimately as part of a textual analysis, literary elements must be specifically identified for that particular text.” (Glossary, Curriculum Guide). The common elements of a story are setting, character, conflict, theme, point of view, and plot. Plot also has its own elements such as exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution or denouement /ˌdeɪˈnuːmɒ̃/. In poetry, there are four essential elements: form, imagery, rhythm, and sound. Poetry comes in different forms such as whether it is free verse, couplet, limerick, etc. Imagery on the other hand is the reason why we see pictures in words and it adds color in any types of literature especially in poetry. Rhythms and sounds are somehow similar. In fact, rhythm falls under the broad category sound. While sound deals with the common use of rhymes and other literary devices such as repetition (repeating of words, phrases, or lines), alliteration  (repeating same consonant sounds), assonance (repeating same vowel sounds), and onomatopoeia (the use of the actual sound to represent someone or something), rhythm is more concerned with the flow of the beat such as whether it is fast or slow. In general, both sounds and rhythms are the key ingredients that give poetry a musical effect (Encyclopedia Britannica). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The term "Traditions" refers to the specific traits of literary works that define a generation or period in history. A literary tradition “is a collection of works that have an underlying interconnectedness and coherence that makes them more than simply a group of works sharing geography or group. Irish poetry and drama, for example, extend over several centuries, involving writers with a range of voices and preoccupations; and yet it is often thought that they are distinctively "Irish." This means that you can have someone who doesn't come from Ireland, perhaps doesn't even have Irish ancestors, but they can write in the Irish Literary Tradition because they will draw on the same references, structure, mythology, focal points for cultural meanings and historical moments.” (Glossary, Curriculum Guide)

                        <h2>Philippine Literature during Colonial Period</h2>
                        <p>
                        Almost half a decade, after the documented discovery of the Philippines in 1521 during Ferdinand Magellan's exploration marks the beginning of the colonial period. The Spaniards successfully colonized the Philippines for more than 300 years having evangelization as its main thrust. The nationalistic consciousness of the Filipinos began when world trade took place in the Philippines as a result of exchanging of liberal ideas with the other countries among children of middle class Filipino families who were sent to Europe. This led to a revolutionary period that ended the long and oppressive Spanish tyranny in our country. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        American period of colonialism officially took place after Emilio Aguinaldo surrendered. The transition period between Spanish and American colonialism did not run smoothly since resistance among the native Filipinos who were threatened by the coming of other colonizers was evident. The setting of public schools during the American period became a necessary tool for popularizing democracy in our country, training Filipinos for citizenship, and embracing the English language. All of which are considered influential to Philippine literature even up to this date. The last colonizers to enter the Philippines were the Japanese who failed to gain the trust of Filipinos and only lasted for less than five years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        An emphasis on Christian doctrine was manifested through various types of texts which replaced stories about heroes and animated creatures to Biblical characters and saints as evidenced by novenas, prayer books, and other printed materials. This makes literature during the Early Spanish Period didactic or intended for teaching morality and conduct for good behavior. Other than books, plays and dramas emerged for recreational purposes. These were mostly poetic in nature and were intended for public performances. When few privileged Filipino men from middle class families were given access to education, they also became fluent in Spanish language which paved the way to production of literary texts by our own natives. Eventually, this led to reforms in the government through underground newspapers and revolts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Threatened by the presence of other colonizers, the transition between Spanish Period and American Period was not smooth due to resistance among Emilio Aguinaldo who was the appointed president at that time and our fellow countrymen. As compared to Spanish regime, American colonizers used democratic approach as manifested by allowing a Filipino to lead the country through elections where Manuel Quezon won over Aguinaldo. Public education was then emphasized during this period where the English language was introduced and embraced by many Filipinos resulting in various literary works in English which were mostly imitative at first. Some notable Filipino writers later on adapted and developed their own theme, styles, and conventions making their works recognizable both nationally and internationally. Watching foreign films replaced the popularity of theatrical shows and novels.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The cruelty of the Japanese occupation was evidenced by strong resistance among the majority of Filipino people. The attempt to erase Western influences was shown when they tried to ban the use of English language during their reign. Freedom of the press and of expression was also suppressed. The Tagalog language was favored by the Japanese which made Tagalog stories and dramas flourish at the time. Love for music was evident through exposure to opera and classical music. Life struggles, nationalism, and patriotism were the common themes and subjects but were secretly published. Only those Filipinos who were living abroad could freely write and express their opinions.
